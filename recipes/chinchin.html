    <h1>How to Make Chin Chin</h1>
   <ol>
        <li>Using a mixer or by hand mix the dry ingredients; flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, nutmeg and lime zest</li>
        <li> Add the butter to the flour and mix well until the butter is well incorporated with the flour.</li>
        <li> Add milk and egg into the mixture. Keep mixing until you have formed a sticky dough ball </li>
        <li>Dump the dough ball onto a floured surface and knead, incorporating more flour into the dough as needed, until the dough is smooth, elastic, and even in color and no longer sticky. Chin-chin can be cut into many shapes and sizes</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half .On a floured board roll each half about 1/6 inches thick. Just like linguine or fettuccine. You can make it easy by using a pasta machine if you have one available. Make shapes as desired. </li>
        <li>Add oil (about 3 inches deep) to a heated skillet/sauce pan or my all time favorite Dutch oven that is over medium heat and bring it to 375 degrees . </li>
        <li>Fry in hot oil until golden .Remove from oil, drain, and serve. You can store this in an air tight container for up to a month.</li>

   </ol>
